This is usefull for displaying future events/posts with no final content in the lists as a teaser but skip those when circling through the items.

    Settings are: The skope/format of the pagination: current month, current year, all entries
    Number of links
    Pagination-Template/Layout-Template

In Contao Version 2.9 the delivered template files must be copied to the /templates Folder manually.
